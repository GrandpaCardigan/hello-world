You are the captain of the Simon, a treasure-hunting ship. Your current mission is to find the three sunken treasure chests that are lurking in the part of the
cean you are in and collect them.

To play, enter the coordinates of the point in the ocean you wish to drop a sonar device. The sonar can find out how far away the closest chest is to it.
For example, the d below marks where the device was dropped, and the 2's represent distances of 2 away from the device. 
The 4's represent distances of 4 away from the device.
